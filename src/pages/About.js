Eating the daily recommended amount of fruits and vegetables can help people reduce their riskTrusted Source of many leading causes of illness and death. These include cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, some cancers, and obesity.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source, the daily recommended amount of fruit is:

Adult females: At least 1 and a half cups of fruit per day
Adult males: At least 2 cups of fruit per day
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) states that at least half of the daily recommended amount of fruit should come from whole fruit. This means that a person should not get their daily recommended allowance from fruit juice alone.

The CDCTrusted Source states that only 12% of adults in the United States consume the recommended amount of fruit.

Compared to whole fruit, fruit juice tends to offer less fiber content and more calories and sugar content.

That is why a person should limit the amount of fruit juice they drink each day.
